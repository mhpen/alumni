# Fixed Alumni Management System Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the fixed version of your Alumni Management System to Render.com.

## Step 1: Build and Push the Fixed Docker Image

1. Make sure you're logged in to Docker Hub:
   ```
   docker login -u ynodev
   ```
   Enter your password when prompted.

2. Run the build script to build and push the fixed Docker image:
   ```
   build-fixed.bat
   ```
   This will build the Docker image with the fixed Flask app and push it to Docker Hub as `ynodev/alumni-combined:fixed`.

## Step 2: Update Your Render.com Deployment

### Option 1: Update Existing Service

1. Log in to your Render.com dashboard
2. Go to your existing service (alumni-management-syih)
3. Click on "Settings"
4. Under "Image", update the Docker image URL to:
   ```
   docker.io/ynodev/alumni-combined:fixed
   ```
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Click on "Manual Deploy" > "Deploy latest image"

### Option 2: Create a New Service

1. Log in to your Render.com dashboard
2. Click on "New" and select "Web Service"
3. Choose "Deploy an existing image from a registry"
4. Enter the following details:
   - **Name**: `alumni-management-system-fixed`
   - **Image URL**: `docker.io/ynodev/alumni-combined:fixed`
   - **Region**: Choose the region closest to your users
   - **Instance Type**: Start with "Starter" plan (or choose based on your needs)
   
5. Set the environment variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI`: `mongodb+srv://dsilva:7DaXRzRoueTBa3a5@alumnimanagement.f10hpn9.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=AlumniManagement`
   - `DATABASE_NAME`: `alumni_management`
   - `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: `your_super_secret_key_for_jwt_tokens`
   - `PORT`: `5000`
   - `HOST`: `0.0.0.0`
   - `DEBUG`: `false`

6. Configure the port:
   - Set the port to `5000`

7. Click "Create Web Service"

### Option 3: Use Render Blueprint

1. Upload the `render-fixed.yaml` file to your GitHub repository
2. Log in to your Render.com dashboard
3. Click on "New" and select "Blueprint"
4. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already
5. Select the repository containing your `render-fixed.yaml` file
6. Click "Apply Blueprint"

## Step 3: Access Your Fixed Application

Once the deployment is complete, you can access your application at the URL provided by Render.

Use the default login credentials:
- Email: admin@alumni.edu
- Password: admin123

## What Was Fixed

The main issue was that the Flask app wasn't correctly configured to serve static files. The fixes include:

1. Explicitly setting the `static_url_path` to `/static` in the Flask app
2. Adding a dedicated route handler for static files that sets the correct Content-Type headers
3. Improving the route handler for the React app to correctly handle different types of requests

These changes ensure that JavaScript and CSS files are served with the correct Content-Type headers, preventing the "Unexpected token '<'" error.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after deploying the fixed version:

1. Check the Render.com logs for any error messages
2. Verify that all environment variables are set correctly
3. Try accessing the application in an incognito/private browsing window to avoid caching issues
4. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
